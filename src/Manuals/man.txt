NAME
	breaking_password_of_a_zip_file \- A tool for cracking the password of a
	protected zip file

SYNOPSIS
	./breaking_password_of_a_zip_file --path-to-archive <PATH_TO_ARCHIVE>
	[COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
	This project features more than one method for cracking zip file
	passwords. Currently, 3 methods are supported: the first is a simple
	brute-force cracker through the creation of anagrams using several
	user-defined letters; the second is via a dictionary attack, where the
	tested passwords must be in a .txt file with each entry separated by a
	newline; the third method combines the two previous approaches—besides
	testing each password individually, it also tests possible anagrams
	formed by those passwords.

OPTIONS
	Mandatorily, begin by calling --path_to_archive flag regardless of the
	command used. This specifies the path to the encrypted file, either from
	the current folder or from the system root. If omitted, the program will
	terminate with an error.

	anagrams
		The "anagrams" command must be called after specifying the path
		to the encrypted file.

		Optionally, call --min_leters_quantity, which is the minimum
		number of letters used in the anagram. It must be an integer
		greater than zero; if omitted, it defaults to 1.

		Optionally, call --max_letters_quantity, which is the maximum
		number of letters used in the anagram. It must be an integer and
		also equal to or greater than --min_leters_quantity; if omitted,
		it will be equal to --min_leters_quantity.

		Optionally, call --letters, which specifies the letters that will
		be used to construct the anagrams. If omitted, it defaults to
		"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"

		Example: ./breaking_password_of_a_zip_file --path_to_archive
		"/home/name/my archive.zip" anagrams --min_letters_quantity 2
		--max_letters_quantity 6 --letters "abcdew"

	manual
		As an exception, you don't need to call --path_to_archive when
		calling man, because that option only shows this mensage.
